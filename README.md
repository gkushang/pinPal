###Mocked services

A Spring profile is used to inject mocks instead of the actual services for development. Beans defined in **/WEB-INF/config/mocks.xml** file
have the 'primary' attribute set to 'true'. This will make Spring choose the beans here over any other beans of the same interface. Spring profile used for mocks is **ora.profiles.mock**.
Refer to section 5.1. on how to enable the behavior. Additionally, you can add **src/mocks/java** path to your Source Folders under Module Settings.
